            Dough Gains is a protein-focused baked goods brand built for active
            lifestyles. Owned and operated by Stella Astbury, each item is made
            fresh from scratch before every market with one goal in mind:
            creating baked goods that actually fuel your day.
          </p>

          <p className="text-stone-300">
            We prioritize protein and intentional macros to support training,
            recovery, and long, busy days — without sacrificing flavor or
            texture. These are baked goods designed to keep you satisfied,
            energized, and ready for whatever’s next.
          </p>

          <p className="text-stone-300">
            You can find us weekly at the Ocean Beach and Little Italy farmers
            markets, where we bring a rotating selection of high-protein bagels,
            pancakes, brownies, and seasonal specials.
          </p>

          <p className="text-stone-400">
            The best part? You wouldn’t know they’re protein-forward just by
            tasting them. Don’t take our word for it — stop by one of our weekly
            markets for samples and see for yourself.
